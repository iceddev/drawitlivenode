Draw It Live - NodeJS version
========================

An open source colaborative whiteboard/communication platform.


You'll need to have volo and grunt installed to properly pull down dependencies and do a build of the javascript.

`sudo npm install grunt volo -g`

Then in the project folder:

`npm install`


and:

`volo install`


You can launch the server with `node app.js`
